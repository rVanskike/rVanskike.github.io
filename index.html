                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        In CS-499, I set several objectives to expand my knowledge in algorithms, data structures, databases, engineering principles, and software design. My artifacts demonstrate my 
                        ability to transition between programming languages while maintaining code integrity, integrating new features through iterative practices, and optimizing data retrieval by 
                        transitioning from lists to dictionaries. I showcased my database proficiency by integrating a PostgreSQL database, leveraging my MongoDB experience. Finally, I demonstrated 
                        my ability to create a secure environment by implementing a secure login system. 
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Completing my coursework throughout the program has helped shape my professional goals. One course that had a significant impact on my career trajectory was current and emerging 
                        trends in computer science. The exposure to machine learning in this course ignited a new passion for understanding neural networks, datasets, and training computers to "learn." 
                        This course influenced my decision to pursue a master’s degree in artificial intelligence, and it has been a key driver in shaping my professional aspirations moving forward.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Developing the ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase my strengths in a more impactful way. While I have always been skilled and experienced in technical writing, I had not 
                        previously focused on how to present my work effectively. Creating this portfolio has provided me with insight into how to better showcase my technical expertise and highlight 
                        my employability in the field of computer science.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        The knowledge I have gained has already extended beyond my coursework as well. As an example, participating in a hackathon at my company led to the development of an AI-driven 
                        application. My contributions in automating troubleshooting processes were recognized by the company, which has filed a patent for this work. This experience was invaluable, 
                        demonstrating how my academic knowledge could directly impact a business model and drive innovation in a real-world environment.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Learning to collaborate and leverage my knowledge has also been beneficial. Such as in my role as the first point of escalation into engineering. I work with global teams to resolve complex 
                        issues, requiring clear communication and coordination. In addition to this, I regularly assist other students through unofficial forums like our student Discord, offering guidance based on 
                        previous courses I have completed. This involvement has deepened my understanding of collaboration and communication in team settings, as I help others apply complex concepts to their work.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Security and Technical Contributions</h2>

                    <p>
                        Throughout the program, I have had to address key security concerns in my projects. In the Grazioso Salvare database project, for example, I applied the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
                         Availability) to secure user data and manage access control. I set up a secure login system by hashing passwords and ensuring the database connection remains open only long enough to 
                         authenticate users. Connection management was handled carefully through instances, meaning connections were closed as soon as they were no longer needed. These implementations reflect 
                         my commitment to upholding best practices in data security.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Summary of Artifacts</h2>

                    <p>
                        At Southern New Hampshire University, I developed diverse skills showcased through three enhancements in my ePortfolio:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Software Design and Engineering</strong>: Transitioned from Java to Python, implementing best practices in inheritance, structure, and modularity. This enhancement laid the 
                            groundwork for future functionality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong>: Implemented new search and edit functions, validation classes, and optimized data retrieval using dictionaries. This was an extension 
                            of the first enhancement, adding more complex operations and validation features.</li>
                        <li><strong>Databases</strong>: Integrated PostgreSQL databases, demonstrating my database management skills and commitment to security. This was the culmination of the prior enhancements, 
                            resulting in a cohesive graphical user interface that is easy to use and maintain for users.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        These artifacts reflect my technical expertise and versatility. Enhancement one provided the building blocks for everything that followed, while enhancement two expanded the project’s 
                        functionality and security. Enhancement three brought everything together, producing a user-friendly interface that integrates all the previous work in a meaningful way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With these artifacts, I achieved the five course outcomes:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Course Outcome 1:</strong>: I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field 
                            of computer science by transitioning to Python, which is known for its easily readable and understood syntax. Additionally, I moved to a centralized PostgreSQL database for data 
                            persistence, allowing for consistent access to data and real-time updates. I also created a user-friendly Tkinter dashboard to enhance collaboration and interaction among users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Course Outcome 2:</strong>: I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and 
                            appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by focusing on improving documentation during the transition from Java to Python. This included implementing detailed comments 
                            and creating comprehensive documentation to ensure that both technical and non-technical stakeholders could easily understand the code's functionality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Course Outcome 3:</strong>: I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards 
                            appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by transitioning the original dataset from a list to a dictionary. This strategic decision 
                            balanced memory efficiency with improved search performance, especially for larger datasets, as dictionaries offer O(1) average time complexity for searches and insertions, meaning 
                            that the time remains constant regardless of size, while lists require O(n), where the search and insertion time increases proportionally with the dataset size. I created two new 
                            functions: one for searching and editing entries and another for input validation. These enhancements allow users to search for animals and edit their details while ensuring that the 
                            entries provided by users are valid. Additionally, I integrated the PostgreSQL database and developed the GUI interface, further improving user interaction and functionality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Course Outcome 4:</strong>: I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing 
                            computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by integrating the PostgreSQL database, developing the Tkinter GUI, and implementing bcrypt for password 
                            encryption. These innovations significantly enhanced the application's security and functionality, aligning it with industry standards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Course Outcome 5:</strong>: I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, 
                            mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by implementing a secure login system using bcrypt hashing and salt generation. This proactive 
                            approach effectively reduced the risk of unauthorized access and ensured the integrity of user data.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

			The second enhancement focuses on continuing advancements for the Grazioso Salvare Dog and Monkey database by enhancing its modularity, efficiency, and data integrity. This artifact builds upon the previous work from the first enhancement, 
			where the database was initially developed in Java and later transitioned to Python. The original application managed basic functions for handling rescue animals but lacked advanced features and scalability.
			<br>
			<br>
			In this enhancement, I introduced two critical modules; search.py and validation.py. The search.py module allows users to search and modify records for dogs and monkeys, significantly improving the system’s functionality. The validation.py 
			module addresses input validation, ensuring that all data entries are accurate and consistent, which was a notable improvement over the initial version that lacked robust validation mechanisms.
			<br>
			<br>
			A significant structural upgrade involved transitioning the data management from simple lists to dictionaries. This change enhanced the efficiency of data retrieval and management. Lists, with their O(n) time complexity for search 
			operations, were replaced with dictionaries, which utilize hash tables to achieve average O(1) time complexity for operations such as search, insert, and delete. This transition is crucial for the anticipated growth in the database, 
			as it maintains high performance even as the data size increases.
			<br>
			<br>
			The validation.py module introduced comprehensive validation checks, such as ensuring unique names and validating the format of dates. These improvements not only enhanced data integrity but also contributed to the overall reliability and usability of the system.
			<br>
			<br>
			This enhancement demonstrates my ability to refine and expand a software system by leveraging Python’s advanced features to improve performance and functionality. It also reflects my progress in applying sophisticated programming 
			techniques and addressing real-world challenges, aligning with industry standards and best practices.

			Enhancement three focused on integrating a PostgreSQL database into the Grazioso Salvare Dog and Monkey application, replacing local in-memory data management with a scalable, reliable 
			database-driven approach. Previously, the application relied on local lists for storing animal data, which limited its scalability.
			<br>
			<br>
			Key improvements included refactoring driver.py to replace in-memory data handling with database communication, and overhauling initialize.py to handle database connections, table creation, 
			and data retrieval. This transition enhanced data management efficiency and accuracy.
			<br>
			<br>
			A new secure login system, added through security.py, restricted database access, significantly improving data security and integrity. Additionally, a Tkinter-based graphical user interface 
			(GUI) was introduced, replacing the terminal interface. The GUI featured easy navigation, a dark theme toggle for user comfort, and a dynamic company logo banner that adapts to the selected 
			theme.
